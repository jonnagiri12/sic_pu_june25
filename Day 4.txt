Mantra:
The code we define/implement must be understandable by any programmer in the world.

The O/P (execution) must be understandable by any common person in the world.

range() is a function in Python which takes a range of values and YIELDS the values one by one from the range depending on the increment.

range(10)
values the range yields are 0 to 9 with increment of +1
range(1, 20)
values the range yields are 1 to 19 with increment of +1
range(1, 20, 3)
values the range yields are 1 to 19 with increment of +3
range(21, 2, -3)
values the range yields are 21 to 3 with increment of -3

range()
input()
print()
len()
min()
max()
